## Operators
#### Search Term

This operator searches only for the exact term inside the quotation marks. You can use this for example if the term you are looking for is ambiguous and could easily be confused with something else, or if you don't get enough relevant results. 

Here is an example:

```
"Admin Loginpage"
```
#### OR
This operator searches for a specific search term OR another term.

```
site:instagram.com | site:github.com
```

#### AND
This operator searches for a specific search term and another term.

```
site:github.com & site:twitter.com
```

#### Operators combinaison
This operator combines search terms 
```
(site:instagram.com | site:twitter.com) (intext:"admin")
(site:instagram.com | site:twitter.com) & intext:"admin"
```

#### Include results

This will order results by the number of occurrence of the keyword.

```
-site:twitter.com +site:twitter.*
```

#### Exclude results

```
site:twitter.* -site:twitter.com
```

### Better Results (Subdomains)
```
site:*.site.com

site:*.*.site.com

site:*.*.*.site.com
```
#### Synonyms

```
~set
```

#### Glob pattern (*)

```

## Preventing GOOGLE DORKS

Encoding/encrypting sensitive data such as usernames, passwords and so forth.
Run inquiries against your own site to check whether you can locate any sensitive data. On the off chance that you discover sensitive information, you can remove it from search results by utilizing Google Search Console.
Protect sensitive content by utilizing a robots.txt document situated in your root-level site catalog. 
Utilizing robots.txt helps prevent Google from indexing our site, but it can also show an attacker where sensitive data might be located.
User-agent: * 
Disallow: / 

You can also block specific directories to be excepted from web crawling. 
If you have the /phpinfo site and you need to protect it, just place this code inside:

User-agent: *   
Disallow: /phpinfo/ 


Restrict access to specific files:

User-agent: *   
Disallow: /member/info.html 


Restrict access to dynamic URLs that contain ? symbol:

User-agent: *   
Disallow: /*?
